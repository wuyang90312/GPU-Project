This project is created in order to signify the advantage of parallism in the process of solving n-body problem. We are comparing the speeds of the serial all-pair Algorithm, serial Barnes-Hut Algorithm, and parallel Barnes-Hut Algorithm.

File Struectue:
/root:
    serial_barnes.c
    serial_all_pair.c
    /utils:
        map_generator.py
        map.csv         Generated by "map_generator.py"
        galaxy.png      Generated by "map_generator.py"

Progress:
March 26    Finished root/utils/map_generator.py. Successfully generator csv file and png file with this code.
March 27    Started to implement the CPU_Barnes.c
